-GUESSING GAME-

Created a guessing game that asks three yes/no questions, stores user's answers, and informs if their guesses were correct or not.
- if/else loops added to create a call and response

Fourth question added that asks user to enter a number 1-10 and based on their input returns if their number was too high too low.
- if/else loops

Added an if/else if condition to log how many questions a user got right overall.

Added a while loop that lets a user guess a number continuously until the user enter the matching one.
