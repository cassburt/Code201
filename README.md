-GUESSING GAME-

Created a guessing game that asks three yes/no questions, stores user's answers, and informs if their guesses were correct or not.
- if/else loops added to create a call and response

Fourth question added that asks user to enter a number 1-10 and based on their input returns if their number was too high too low.
- if/else loops

Added an if/else if condition to log how many questions a user got right overall.

Added a while loop that lets a user guess a number continuously until the user enter the matching one.

Added functions to condense code and eliminate repetition. Combined the while loop and the highOrLow if/else loop into one while loop to cut repetition and added a variable that generates a random number to compare user's input to.

Modified the guessing game with arrays and a for loop for more concise, efficient code.

Put the guessing number while loop in a function. Added a button to page and set both the guessing game and the number guessing game to start onclick. Added a CSS folder and added some CSS to the project.
